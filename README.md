# Dev Journey Blog

My development journey.

## Goals 🏁

The reasons for creating this blog are:

🔮 A glimpse into what I'm learning and doing

🖋️ Reinforce understanding of topics by writing about them

🗃️ Self accountability

## Topics 📚

The topics I will write about will vary a lot, since it will be mostly to help myself get a better understanding by forcing my to write and teach others.

However, the broad umbrellas :umbrella: under which they will fall are as follows:

- [x] Algorithms and Data Structures (Possibly some leetcode🤖)
- [x] Frontend development (React⚛️, Astro🚀 and vanilla🍦)
- [x] Backend development (Python🐉, Go🦫 and Node.js🟢)
- [x] Cybersecurity (Possibly some writeups 📝)
- [x] System Administration (services⚙️, networking🌐 and docker🐳)
